# Python Template Package

PyPkg is a template package to guide you setup your own Python package.
It can be cloned and used as a starting point for your project.
We also want to use this documentation to help users understand key concepts
when building a Python package, include

* Project organization
* Style guide
* Testing and documentation
* Continuous integration and deployment

It will bring standards, consistency and best practices into your projects and
make collaborations easier.
